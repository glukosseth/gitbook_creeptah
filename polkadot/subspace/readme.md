The Subspace Network lets developers run Web3 apps at Internet scale. It provides a simple interface for quickly deploying multi-chain decentralized apps that auto-scale with demand. Subspace is powered by a new eco-friendly, 4th generation blockchain that enables massively scalable on-chain storage and compute without compromising security or decentralization. It seamlessly integrates with existing blockchains, layer two protocols, and decentralized applications, allowing it to serve as a foundational infrastructure layer for the entire Web3 ecosystem. Subspace will empower builders to unlock the next wave of crypto adoption by supporting NFTs, GameFi, and the Metaverse at Internet scale.

The Subspace Blockchain was created to solve several fundamental problems in the cryptocurrency space around environmental sustainability, increased centralization, and lack of scalability. These goals were achieved thanks to a new twist on an old idea, Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus.
