# Obol

Obol is building a trust minimized staking protocol for public blockchain networks based on Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). DVT enables validators to configure clusters with active-active redundancy, an improvement on the widely used configuration of active-passive redundancy.

This is achieved by being able to split a validator key across multiple independently operating instances and utilizing threshold signing to perform consensus duties. You can think of this as enabling your validator to operate like a multi-sig, removing single points of technical failure including:
- Availability Failure
- Validator Key Compromise

Our mission is to evolve DVT by building a crypto economic protocol and diverse community that can enable the primitive to become a sustainable public good, increasing the security and resiliency of public blockchain networks. We will begin this mission by focusing on building solutions to support the future of Ethereum POS.
